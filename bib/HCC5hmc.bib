	Abstract = {5-Hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) is an important mammalian DNA epigenetic modification that has been linked to gene regulation and cancer pathogenesis. Here we explored the diagnostic potential of 5hmC in circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) using a sensitive chemical labeling-based low-input shotgun sequencing approach. We sequenced cell-free 5hmC from 49 patients of seven different cancer types and found distinct features that could be used to predict cancer types and stages with high accuracy. Specifically, we discovered that lung cancer leads to a progressive global loss of 5hmC in cfDNA, whereas hepatocellular carcinoma and pancreatic cancer lead to disease-specific changes in the cell-free hydroxymethylome. Our proof-of-principle results suggest that cell-free 5hmC signatures may potentially be used not only to identify cancer types but also to track tumor stage in some cancers.},

	Abstract = {Cell-free circulating DNA (cfDNA) in plasma has gained global interest as a diagnostic material for noninvasive prenatal testing and cancer diagnosis, or the so-called "liquid biopsy". Recent studies have discovered a great number of valuable genetic and epigenetic biomarkers for cfDNA-based liquid biopsy. Considering that the genetic biomarkers, e.g., somatic mutations, usually vary from case to case in most cancer patients, epigenetic biomarkers that are generalizable across various samples thus possess certain advantages. In this study, we reviewed the most recent studies and advances on utilizing epigenetic biomarkers for liquid biopsies. We first reviewed more traditional methods of using tissue/cancer-specific DNA methylation biomarkers and digital PCR or sequencing technologies for cancer diagnosis, as well as tumor origin determination. In the second part, we discussed the emerging novel approaches for exploring the biological basis and clinical applications of cfDNA fragmentation patterns. We further provided our comments and points of view on the future directions on epigenetic biomarker development for cfDNA-based liquid biopsies.},

	Abstract = {Profiling breast cancer with expression arrays has become common, and it has been suggested that the results from early studies will lead to understanding of the molecular differences between clinical cases and allow individualization of care. We critically review two main applications of expression profiling; studies unraveling novel breast cancer classifications and those that aim to identify novel markers for prediction of clinical outcome. Breast cancer may now be subclassified into luminal, basal, and HER2 subtypes with distinct differences in prognosis and response to therapy. However, profiling studies to identify predictive markers have suffered from methodologic problems that prevent general application of their results. Future work will need to reanalyze existing microarray data sets to identify more representative sets of candidate genes for use as prognostic signatures and will need to take into account the new knowledge of molecular subtypes of breast cancer when assessing predictive effects.},

In addition to discussing general pitfalls of microarray experiments, we also critically review the key breast cancer studies to highlight methodological problems in cohort selection, statistical analysis, validation of results and reporting of raw data. We conclude that the optimum use of microarrays in clinical studies requires further optimisation and standardisation of methodology and reporting, together with improvements in clinical study design.},

@article{Lonning:2005aa,
	Abstract = {The introduction of DNA microarray techniques has had dramatic implications on cancer research, allowing researchers to analyze expression of multiple genes in concert and relate the findings to clinical parameters. The main discoveries in breast cancer, as well as in other malignancies, have so far been with respect to two key issues. First, individual tumors arising from the same organ may be grouped into distinct classes based on their gene expression profiles, independent of stage and grade. Second, the biologic relevance of such classification is corroborated by significant prognostic impact. We review how the use of microarray technologies can provide unique possibilities to explore the mechanisms of tumor behavior in vivo that will allow evaluation of prognosis and, potentially, drug resistance. However, in spite of recent advances, we are not yet at a stage where the use of these techniques should be implemented for routine clinical use, whether to define prognostic factors or to predict sensitivity to therapy.},

@article{Michiels:2005aa,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: General studies of microarray gene-expression profiling have been undertaken to predict cancer outcome. Knowledge of this gene-expression profile or molecular signature should improve treatment of patients by allowing treatment to be tailored to the severity of the disease. We reanalysed data from the seven largest published studies that have attempted to predict prognosis of cancer patients on the basis of DNA microarray analysis. METHODS: The standard strategy is to identify a molecular signature (ie, the subset of genes most differentially expressed in patients with different outcomes) in a training set of patients and to estimate the proportion of misclassifications with this signature on an independent validation set of patients. We expanded this strategy (based on unique training and validation sets) by using multiple random sets, to study the stability of the molecular signature and the proportion of misclassifications. FINDINGS: The list of genes identified as predictors of prognosis was highly unstable; molecular signatures strongly depended on the selection of patients in the training sets. For all but one study, the proportion misclassified decreased as the number of patients in the training set increased. Because of inadequate validation, our chosen studies published overoptimistic results compared with those from our own analyses. Five of the seven studies did not classify patients better than chance. INTERPRETATION: The prognostic value of published microarray results in cancer studies should be considered with caution. We advocate the use of validation by repeated random sampling.},

@article{Fu:2005aa,
	Abstract = {Motivation: The standard paradigm for a classifier design is to obtain a sample of feature-label pairs and then to apply a classification rule to derive a classifier from the sample data. Typically in laboratory situations the sample size is limited by cost, time or availability of sample material. Thus, an investigator may wish to consider a sequential approach in which there is a sufficient number of patients to train a classifier in order to make a sound decision for diagnosis while at the same time keeping the number of patients as small as possible to make the studies affordable.Results: A sequential classification procedure is studied via the martingale central limit theorem. It updates the classification rule at each step and provides stopping criteria to ensure with a certain confidence that at stopping a future subject will have misclassification probability smaller than a predetermined threshold. Simulation studies and applications to microarray data analysis are provided. The procedure possesses several attractive properties: (1) it updates the classification rule sequentially and thus does not rely on distributions of primary measurements from other studies; (2) it assesses the stopping criteria at each sequential step and thus can substantially reduce cost via early stopping; and (3) it is not restricted to any particular classification rule and therefore applies to any parametric or non-parametric method, including feature selection or extraction.Availability: R-code for the sequential stopping rule is available at http://stat.tamu.edu/\~{}wfu/microarray/sequential/R-code.htmlContact:wfu{\char64}stat.tamu.edu},

	Abstract = {Many gene expression studies attempt to develop a predictor of pre-defined diagnostic or prognostic classes. If the classes are similar biologically, then the number of genes that are differentially expressed between the classes is likely to be small compared to the total number of genes measured. This motivates a two-step process for predictor development, a subset of differentially expressed genes is selected for use in the predictor and then the predictor constructed from these. Both these steps will introduce variability into the resulting classifier, so both must be incorporated in sample size estimation. We introduce a methodology for sample size determination for prediction in the context of high-dimensional data that captures variability in both steps of predictor development. The methodology is based on a parametric probability model, but permits sample size computations to be carried out in a practical manner without extensive requirements for preliminary data. We find that many prediction problems do not require a large training set of arrays for classifier development.},

@article{Ein-Dor:2006aa,
	Abstract = {Predicting at the time of discovery the prognosis and metastatic potential of cancer is a major challenge in current clinical research. Numerous recent studies searched for gene expression signatures that outperform traditionally used clinical parameters in outcome prediction. Finding such a signature will free many patients of the suffering and toxicity associated with adjuvant chemotherapy given to them under current protocols, even though they do not need such treatment. A reliable set of predictive genes also will contribute to a better understanding of the biological mechanism of metastasis. Several groups have published lists of predictive genes and reported good predictive performance based on them. However, the gene lists obtained for the same clinical types of patients by different groups differed widely and had only very few genes in common. This lack of agreement raised doubts about the reliability and robustness of the reported predictive gene lists, and the main source of the problem was shown to be the small number of samples that were used to generate the gene lists. Here, we introduce a previously undescribed mathematical method, probably approximately correct (PAC) sorting, for evaluating the robustness of such lists. We calculate for several published data sets the number of samples that are needed to achieve any desired level of reproducibility. For example, to achieve a typical overlap of 50{\%} between two predictive lists of genes, breast cancer studies would need the expression profiles of several thousand early discovery patients.},

	N2 = {Pancreatic cancers are typically diagnosed at late stage where disease prognosis is poor as exemplified by a 5-year survival rate of 8.2{\%}. Earlier diagnosis would be beneficial by enabling surgical resection or earlier application of therapeutic regimens. We investigated the detection of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in a non-invasive manner by interrogating changes in 5-hydroxymethylation cytosine status (5hmC) of circulating cell free DNA in the plasma of a PDAC cohort (n=51) in comparison with a non-cancer cohort (n=41). We found that 5hmC sites are enriched in a disease and stage specific manner in exons, 3'UTRs and transcription termination sites. Our data show that 5hmC density is reduced in promoters and histone H3K4me3-associated sites with progressive disease suggesting increased transcriptional activity. 5hmC density is differentially represented in thousands of genes, and a stringently filtered set of the most significant genes points to biology related to pancreas (GATA4, GATA6, PROX1, ONECUT1) and/or cancer development (YAP1, TEAD1, PROX1, ONECUT1, ONECUT2, IGF1 and IGF2). Regularized regression models were built using 5hmC densities in statistically filtered genes or a comprehensive set of highly variable 5hmC counts in genes and performed with an AUC = 0.94-0.96 on training data. We were able to test the ability to classify PDAC and non-cancer samples with the Elastic net and Lasso models on two external pancreatic cancer 5hmC data sets and found validation performance to be AUC = 0.74-0.97. The findings suggest that 5hmC changes enable classification of PDAC patients with high fidelity and are worthy of further investigation on larger cohorts of patient samples.},

@article{Dobbin:2008aa,
	Abstract = {PURPOSE: A common goal of gene expression microarray studies is the development of a classifier that can be used to divide patients into groups with different prognoses, or with different expected responses to a therapy. These types of classifiers are developed on a training set, which is the set of samples used to train a classifier. The question of how many samples are needed in the training set to produce a good classifier from high-dimensional microarray data is challenging. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We present a model-based approach to determining the sample size required to adequately train a classifier. RESULTS: It is shown that sample size can be determined from three quantities: standardized fold change, class prevalence, and number of genes or features on the arrays. Numerous examples and important experimental design issues are discussed. The method is adapted to address ex post facto determination of whether the size of a training set used to develop a classifier was adequate. An interactive web site for performing the sample size calculations is provided. CONCLUSION: We showed that sample size calculations for classifier development from high-dimensional microarray data are feasible, discussed numerous important considerations, and presented examples.},

@article{Kim:2009aa,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Few overlap between independently developed gene signatures and poor inter-study applicability of gene signatures are two of major concerns raised in the development of microarray-based prognostic gene signatures. One recent study suggested that thousands of samples are needed to generate a robust prognostic gene signature. RESULTS: A data set of 1,372 samples was generated by combining eight breast cancer gene expression data sets produced using the same microarray platform and, using the data set, effects of varying samples sizes on a few performances of a prognostic gene signature were investigated. The overlap between independently developed gene signatures was increased linearly with more samples, attaining an average overlap of 16.56{\%} with 600 samples. The concordance between predicted outcomes by different gene signatures also was increased with more samples up to 94.61{\%} with 300 samples. The accuracy of outcome prediction also increased with more samples. Finally, analysis using only Estrogen Receptor-positive (ER+) patients attained higher prediction accuracy than using both patients, suggesting that sub-type specific analysis can lead to the development of better prognostic gene signatures CONCLUSION: Increasing sample sizes generated a gene signature with better stability, better concordance in outcome prediction, and better prediction accuracy. However, the degree of performance improvement by the increased sample size was different between the degree of overlap and the degree of concordance in outcome prediction, suggesting that the sample size required for a study should be determined according to the specific aims of the study.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Supervised learning methods need annotated data in order to generate efficient models. Annotated data, however, is a relatively scarce resource and can be expensive to obtain. For both passive and active learning methods, there is a need to estimate the size of the annotated sample required to reach a performance target. METHODS: We designed and implemented a method that fits an inverse power law model to points of a given learning curve created using a small annotated training set. Fitting is carried out using nonlinear weighted least squares optimization. The fitted model is then used to predict the classifier's performance and confidence interval for larger sample sizes. For evaluation, the nonlinear weighted curve fitting method was applied to a set of learning curves generated using clinical text and waveform classification tasks with active and passive sampling methods, and predictions were validated using standard goodness of fit measures. As control we used an un-weighted fitting method. RESULTS: A total of 568 models were fitted and the model predictions were compared with the observed performances. Depending on the data set and sampling method, it took between 80 to 560 annotated samples to achieve mean average and root mean squared error below 0.01. Results also show that our weighted fitting method outperformed the baseline un-weighted method (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This paper describes a simple and effective sample size prediction algorithm that conducts weighted fitting of learning curves. The algorithm outperformed an un-weighted algorithm described in previous literature. It can help researchers determine annotation sample size for supervised machine learning.},

	N2 = {DNA modifications such as 5-methylcytosines (5mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosines (5hmC) are epigenetic marks known to affect global gene expression in mammals(1, 2). Given their prevalence in the human genome, close correlation with gene expression, and high chemical stability, these DNA epigenetic marks could serve as ideal biomarkers for cancer diagnosis. Taking advantage of a highly sensitive and selective chemical labeling technology(3), we report here genome-wide 5hmC profiling in circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and in genomic DNA of paired tumor/adjacent tissues collected from a cohort of 90 healthy individuals and 260 patients recently diagnosed with colorectal, gastric, pancreatic, liver, or thyroid cancer. 5hmC was mainly distributed in transcriptionally active regions coincident with open chromatin and permissive histone modifications. Robust cancer-associated 5hmC signatures in cfDNA were identified with specificity for different cancers. 5hmC-based biomarkers of circulating cfDNA demonstrated highly accurate predictive value for patients with colorectal and gastric cancers versus healthy controls, superior to conventional biomarkers, and comparable to 5hmC biomarkers from tissue biopsies. This new strategy could lead to the development of effective blood-based, minimally-invasive cancer diagnosis and prognosis approaches.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: Accurate early anticipation of long-term irreversible brain damage during the acute phase of patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) remains difficult. Using a combination of clinical scores together with brain injury-related biomarkers (H-FABP, NDKA, UFD1 and S100beta), this study aimed at developing a multiparameter prognostic panel to facilitate early outcome prediction following aSAH. METHODS: Blood samples of 141 aSAH patients from two separated cohorts (sets of 28 and 113 patients) were prospectively enrolled and analyzed with 14 months of delay. Patients were admitted within 48 h following aSAH onset. A venous blood sample was withdrawn within 12 h after admission. H-FABP, NDKA, UFD1, S100beta and troponin I levels were determined using classical immunoassays. The World Federation of Neurological Surgeons (WFNS) at admission and the Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS) at 6 months were evaluated. RESULTS: In the two cohorts, blood concentration of H-FABP, S100beta and troponin I at admission significantly predicted unfavorable outcome (GOS 1-2-3). A multivariate analysis identified a six-parameter panel, including WFNS, H-FABP, S100beta, troponin I, NDKA and UFD-1; when at least three of these parameters were simultaneously above cutoff values, prediction of unfavorable outcome reached around 70% sensitivity in both cohorts for 100% specificity. CONCLUSION: The use of this panel, including four brain injury-related proteins, one cardiac marker and a clinical score, could be a valuable tool to identify aSAH patients at risk of poor outcome.},

The new test is shown by simulation to have very similar operating characteristics to the standard method based on comparisons of the areas when the curves are parallel, but markedly superior power when the curves cross, that is when the curves are different but have similar areas. The prospects of generalising the approach to unpaired experiments and to comparisons of ordinal rating data are discussed.},

As these permutations are made within modality, the permutation test is valid even if both modalities are measured on different scales. We show that our permutation test is a sign test for the symmetry of an underlying discrete distribution whose size remains valid under the assumption of equal AUCs.

We developed an exact non-parametric statistical procedure for comparing two ROC curves in paired design settings. The test which is based on all permutations of the subject specific rank ratings is formally a test for equality of ROC curves that is sensitive to the alternatives of AUC difference. The operating characteristics of the proposed test were evaluated using extensive simulations over a wide range of parameters. The proposed procedure can be easily implemented in experimental ROC data sets. For small samples and for underlying parameters that are common in experimental studies in diagnostic imaging the test possesses good operating characteristics and is more powerful than the conventional non-parametric procedure for AUC comparisons. We also derived an asymptotic version of the test which uses an exact estimate of the variance in the permutation space and provides a good approximation even when the sample sizes are small. This asymptotic procedure is a simple and precise approximation to the exact test and is useful for large sample sizes where the exact test may be computationally burdensome.

However, because the distributions of the scores in these 2 groups most often overlap, any cut point that is chosen will result in 2 types of errors: false negatives (that is, abnormal cases judged to be normal) and false positives (that is, normal cases placed in the abnormal group). Changing the cut point will alter the numbers of erroneous judgments but will not eliminate the problem. A technique called receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves allows us to determine the ability ofa test to discriminate between groups, to choose the optimal cut point, and to compare the performance of 2 or more tests.

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: Area under a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (Az) is widely used as an index of diagnostic performance. However, Az is not a meaningful summary of clinical diagnostic performance when high sensitivity must be maintained clinically. The authors developed a new ROC partial area index, which measures clinical diagnostic performance more meaningfully in such situations, to summarize an ROC curve in only a high-sensitivity region. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The mathematical formation of the partial area index was derived from the conventional binormal model. Statistical tests of apparent differences in this index were formulated analogous to that of Az.

However, Az is not a meaningful summary of clinical diagnostic performance when high sensitivity must be maintained clinically. The authors developed a new ROC partial area index, which measures clinical diagnostic performance more meaningfully in such situations, to summarize an ROC curve in only a high-sensitivity region. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The mathematical formation of the partial area index was derived from the conventional binormal model. Statistical tests of apparent differences in this index were formulated analogous to that of Az. One common statistical test involving the partial area index was validated by computer simulations under realistic conditions. RESULTS: An example in mammography illustrates a situation in which the partial area index is more meaningful than Az in measuring clinical diagnostic performance. CONCLUSION: The partial area index can be used as a more meaningful alternative to the conventional Az index for highly sensitive diagnostic tests.},

	Abstract = {The area under the ROC curve is a common index summarizing the information contained in the curve. When comparing two ROC curves, though, problems arise when interest does not lie in the entire range of false-positive rates (and hence the entire area). Numerical integration is suggested for evaluating the area under a portion of the ROC curve. Variance estimates are derived. The method is applicable for either continuous or rating scale binormal data, from independent or dependent samples. An example is presented which looks at rating scale data of computed tomographic scans of the head with and without concomitant use of clinical history. The areas under the two ROC curves over an a priori range of false-positive rates are examined, as well as the areas under the two curves at a specific point.},

	Abstract = {Motivation: The receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves are commonly used in biomedical applications to judge the performance of a discriminant across varying decision thresholds. The estimated ROC curve depends on the true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR), with the key metric being the area under the curve (AUC). With small samples these rates need to be estimated from the training data, so a natural question arises: How well do the estimates of the AUC, TPR and FPR compare with the true metrics?Results: Through a simulation study using data models and analysis of real microarray data, we show that (i) for small samples the root mean square differences of the estimated and true metrics are considerable; (ii) even for large samples, there is only weak correlation between the true and estimated metrics; and (iii) generally, there is weak regression of the true metric on the estimated metric. For classification rules, we consider linear discriminant analysis, linear support vector machine (SVM) and radial basis function SVM. For error estimation, we consider resubstitution, three kinds of cross-validation and bootstrap. Using resampling, we show the unreliability of some published ROC results.Availability: Companion web site at http://compbio.tgen.org/paper{\_}supp/ROC/roc.htmlContact:edward{\char64}mail.ece.tamu.edu},

	Abstract = {Among algorithms for comparing the areas under two or more correlated receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, DeLong's algorithm is perhaps the most widely used one due to its simplicity of implementation in practice. Unfortunately, however, the time complexity of DeLong's algorithm is of quadratic order (the product of sample sizes), thus making it time-consuming and impractical when the sample sizes are large. Based on an equivalent relationship between the Heaviside function and mid-ranks of samples, we improve DeLong's algorithm by reducing the order of time complexity from quadratic down to linearithmic (the product of sample size and its logarithm). Monte Carlo simulations verify the computational efficiency of our algorithmic findings in this work.},

	Abstract = {A representation and interpretation of the area under a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve obtained by the "rating" method, or by mathematical predictions based on patient characteristics, is presented. It is shown that in such a setting the area represents the probability that a randomly chosen diseased subject is (correctly) rated or ranked with greater suspicion than a randomly chosen non-diseased subject. Moreover, this probability of a correct ranking is the same quantity that is estimated by the already well-studied nonparametric Wilcoxon statistic. These two relationships are exploited to (a) provide rapid closed-form expressions for the approximate magnitude of the sampling variability, i.e., standard error that one uses to accompany the area under a smoothed ROC curve, (b) guide in determining the size of the sample required to provide a sufficiently reliable estimate of this area, and (c) determine how large sample sizes should be to ensure that one can statistically detect differences in the accuracy of diagnostic techniques.},

Indeed, although in the symmetric case both match, we consider different unbalanced situations in which Kappa exhibits an undesired behaviour, i.e. a worse classifier gets higher Kappa score, differing qualitatively from that of MCC. The debate about the incoherence in the behaviour of Kappa revolves around the convenience, or not, of using a relative metric, which makes the interpretation of its values difficult. We extend these concerns by showing that its pitfalls can go even further. Through experimentation, we present a novel approach to this topic. We carry on a comprehensive study that identifies an scenario in which the contradictory behaviour among MCC and Kappa emerges. Specifically, we find out that when there is a decrease to zero of the entropy of the elements out of the diagonal of the confusion matrix associated to a classifier, the discrepancy between Kappa and MCC rise, pointing to an anomalous performance of the former. We believe that this finding disables Kappa to be used in general as a performance measure to compare classifiers.},

We sought to develop a non-invasive diagnostic approach using circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) for the early detection of HCC.Design Applying the 5hmC-Seal technique, we obtained genome-wide 5-hydroxymethylcytosines (5hmC) in cfDNA samples from 2554 Chinese subjects: 1204 patients with HCC, 392 patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection (CHB) or liver cirrhosis (LC) and 958 healthy individuals and patients with benign liver lesions. A diagnostic model for early HCC was developed through case-control analyses using the elastic net regularisation for feature selection.Results The 5hmC-Seal data from patients with HCC showed a genome-wide distribution enriched with liver-derived enhancer marks. We developed a 32-gene diagnostic model that accurately distinguished early HCC (stage 0/A) based on the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer staging system from non-HCC (validation set: area under curve (AUC)=88.4{\%}; (95{\%} CI 85.8{\%} to 91.1{\%})), showing superior performance over α-fetoprotein (AFP). Besides detecting patients with early stage or small tumours (eg, ≤2.0 cm) from non-HCC, the 5hmC model showed high capacity for distinguishing early HCC from high risk subjects with CHB or LC history (validation set: AUC=84.6{\%}; (95{\%} CI 80.6{\%} to 88.7{\%})), also significantly outperforming AFP. Furthermore, the 5hmC diagnostic model appeared to be independent from potential confounders (eg, smoking/alcohol intake history).Conclusion We have developed and validated a non-invasive approach with clinical application potential for the early detection of HCC that are still surgically resectable in high risk individuals.},
