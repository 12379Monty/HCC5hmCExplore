* Two data packages are required:
   - HCC 5hmC-Seq: devtools::install_github("12379Monty/GSE112679")
   - BC RNA-Seq: devtools::install_github("12379Monty/GSE96058")
      - takes a while ...

* rmd_files: parameter in _bookdown.yml controls which Rmd files are knitted in what order.

* to knit the book from the command line:
    % nohup Rscript -e "bookdown::render_book('index.Rmd')"  > render_book.log &

* Heavy use of caching is made within the Rmd files (which is generally considered 
bad practice, but it saves a lot of time when making small many small changes)
   - **This can lead to unexpected and/or misleading results** eg. when the cache is
broken for an R chunk but not its dependents.
   - To break cache, change any line inside the chunk eg add a comment - ### CLEAR CACHE 
   - Sometimes may be good to reknit the entire article.  To accomplish this
      % rm -rf docs
      % rm -rf _bookdown_files
      % nohup Rscript -e "bookdown::render_book('index.Rmd')"  > render_book.log &

* sections of the paper can be executed independently with some order restrictions:
   - 03-preprocHCC5hmC.Rmd needs to be processed before 04-glmnetFitsHCC5hmC.Rmd
and 05-glmnetSuiteHCC5hmC.Rmd
   - 06-preprocBrCaRNASeq.Rmd needs to be processed before 07-glmnetFitsBrCaRNASeq.Rmd and
   08-glmnnetSuiteBrCaRNASeq.Rmd
