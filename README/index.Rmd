## DNA Hydroxymethylation in Hepatocellular Carcinoma

This repo contains a report of exploratory analyses of 
data methylation profiles collected to investigate
genome-wide mapping of 5-hydroxymethylcytosines
in circulating cell-free DNA as reported in Cai et al. (2019)
(https://gut.bmj.com/content/68/12/2195).
The data are available from NCBI GEO 
[Series GSE112679](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE112679).
The data are also available through a an R package -
[GSE112679](https://12379monty.github.io/GSE112679).

## `r emo::ji("construction")` 

An R package providing tools to reproduce the analyses 
reported here is also available: [omicScaleR](https://github.com/12379Monty/omicScaleR.git)

The analysis report page can be found 

A bookdown workflow builds a publishes the report 
[here](https://hcc-5hmc-explore.netlify.app/)
