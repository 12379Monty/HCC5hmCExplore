## DNA Hydroxymethylation in Hepatocellular Carcinoma

This repo contains a report of exploratory analyses of data methylation
profiles collected to investigate genome-wide mapping of
5-hydroxymethylcytosines in circulating cell-free DNA as reported in Cai
et al.Â (2019) (<https://gut.bmj.com/content/68/12/2195>). The data are
available from NCBI GEO [Series
GSE112679](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE112679).
The data are also available through a an R package -
[GSE112679](https://12379monty.github.io/GSE112679).

## ðŸš§

An R package providing tools to reproduce the analyses reported here is
also available:
[omicScaleR](https://github.com/12379Monty/omicScaleR.git)

The analysis report page can be found
